<pre id="changelist1020684951754796022" style="display: none">Major New Features
------------------
- Deep tmux integration!
  Have you ever had an ssh session lost because you had to reboot, had a network
  failure, or the power went out? Are you tired of giving up a keystroke to tmux
  or screen? Suffer no longer! iTerm2 and tmux are now deeply integrated. By
  installing a special version of tmux, it gains the ability to speak directly to
  iTerm2. When you run tmux with -CC, iTerm2 will open real, native windows or
  tabs for each tmux window. The whole state of your tmux session is reflected in
  native iTerm2 windows. As you interact with a window, your typing is sent back
  to tmux. Any time you resize a window, add a split pane, close a split pane,
  close a window, or open a window (with Shell-&gt;tmux-&gt;new window), that
  action happens in tmux as well as in iTerm2.
  All the details are at https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/TmuxIntegration

- A "Toolbelt" has been added. It's a drawer that opens to the right of a
  window and shows running jobs, paste history, a field for taking notes, and
  lets you open new windows/tabs/splits. Look for the Toolbelt menu.

- Add "triggers." A trigger is an action that is performed when text matching
  some regular expression is received in a terminal session. More info here:
  http://www.iterm2.com/triggers.html

- Add "coprocesses." A coprocess is a process, such as a script, that receives
  input from a terminal and whose output is fed into the terminal session as
  though the user were typing it. You can use them to automate interaction with
  scripts, download files with ZModem, and more. More info here:
  http://iterm2.com/coprocesses.html

- You can now edit the smart selection regexes in
  Prefs&gt;Profiles&gt;Advanced. You can also assign actions that are added to
  the context menu when you right click on text that matches a smart selection
  rule.  More info here:
  http://www.iterm2.com/smartselection.html

- Support for OS 10.7 features including fullscreen, retina graphics, and
  window restoration.


New Preferences
---------------
- Add support for tiled background images (Foy Savas)
- Add a preference to toggle hiding of the menu bar in non-Lion fullscreen.
  Useful in Mavericks multi-monitor setups.
- Make tabview toggleable in fullscreen.
- Add option to dim background windows.
- Add option to dim only foreground colors.
- Add UI for adjusting dimming amount.
- Add UI to make blur radius configurable.

- Add preference to disable dimming animation.
- Add option to profiles to send text to shell at startup.
- Add option to disable session-initiated printing.
- Add support for loading prefs from a custom folder (e.g., Dropbox) or URL.
  This makes it easy to share a config between multiple machines or people.
- Add auto logging of sessions. When enabled (per-profile), all input received
  from the host in a session is saved to a file tagged with the window, tag,
  and pane number, plus the time and date of initiation.
- Add next/previous pane action.
- Change around prompt-to-quit options, adding "always/never/only if jobs
  besides ... are running" to profiles-sessions.
- Add option to copy trailing newlines when making a selection that includes a
  whole line at its end.
- Add preference to disable transparency when entering fullscreen mode.
- Improve "Terminal.app Compatibility" key preset to more accurately emulate
  Terminal.
- You can now configure what happens when you cmd-click on a filename in
  Prefs&gt;Profiles&gt;Advanced.
- Add key action to move tab left/right.
- Add "advanced" directory settings for separate tab, window, and pane settings.
- Add preference for setting locale vars.
- Add preference to disable saving lines to the scrollback buffer while in
  alternate screen mode.
- Add option to always copy preferences to prefs stored in a custom folder.
- Add a new panel to prefs to make mouse actions configurable.
- Add option to make triple-click select a whole wrapped line rather than just
  one row.
- Add hidden option AutocompleteMaxOptions to adjust number of autocomplete
  entries.
- Add hidden option PasteHistoryMaxOptions to adjust number of paste history
  entries.
- Add hidden variable URLCharacterSet that defines characters that are part of
  a URL.
- Disable title reporting unless hidden pref AllowInsecureTitleReporting is set
  to true.
- Add general preference "Adjust window for font size change". Turn it off so
  that the window size stays fixed as the font grows or shrinks (thanks,
  keeyipchan!).
- Add hidden preference PinchToChangeFontSizeDisabled to turn off pinch to
  change font size
- Ask for confirmation before deleting a profile.
- Add boolean hidden pref, OpenFileInNewWindows. When you open a file (e.g., a
  shell script) in finder with iTerm2, this controls whether it opens in a new
window or tab.
- Additional window styles: bottom and left of screen.

New Terminal Features
---------------------
- Add support for italics (Stefan Schüßler)
- Change RIS code to move the cursor to the origin (saitoha).
- Convert text to NFC form more aggressively, which should lead to latin
  characters with accents rendering more consistently with certain fonts like
  Inconsolata, which lacks some combining marks.
- Add ITERM_SESSION_ID environment variable that identifiers the window, tab,
  and pane number of each session.
- Add escape code "Esc c" to reset terminal.
- Add new escape code ESC ]6;1;bg;*;default^G to restore tab color to default.
- Add support for reporting focus lost/gained. esc[?1004h turns it on; then the
  terminal sends esc[I when focusing, esc[O when de-focusing. Send esc[?1004l
  to disable.
- Implemented bracketed paste mode (this is cool, see vim script here:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5585129
- Define VLNEXT and VDISCARD in the term by default.
- Add support for the "screen" terminal's way of setting the window title.
- Support SGR (1006) mouse reporting.
- Allow OSC 4 to set color of first 16 palette entries.
- Add support for OSC 52 (clipboard integration--thanks, saitoha!).
- Add support for DECSCUSR which lets the terminal change the cursor shape and
  blink.
- Add support for DECSTR (esc [!p)

Other Features
--------------
- Improve rendering on glyphs with multiple combining marks.
- When you cmd-click on a filename in a diff, remove the a/ or b/ prefix and
  replace with the real directory to open the file.
- Cmd-opt click on a URL to open it without bringing the browser to the front.
- Improve "send input to all sessions", adding new modes: 1) send to all panes
  in current tab, 2) to all sessions in current window, and 3) to an arbitrary
  collection of panes (toggled with context menu).
- You can toggle send input to all tabs/panes by re-pressing the keystroke that
  got you into that mode.
- Draw a dotted line around maximized sessions.
- Add support for multiple saved window arrangements.
- Add decimal <-> hex conversion to right-click context menu when a number is
  selected.
- Add new cmd-opt-shift-H and cmd-opt-shift-v interface for opening a split
  pane with a particular profile.
- Allow pinch gesture to change font size.
- Make cmd-[ and cmd-] work when a pane is maximized.
- Add "find cursor" feature (cmd-/) that highlights the cursor location. Useful
  when you have a huge terminal, this makes it easy to quickly find a lost
  cursor. If activated with the shortcut cmd-/, continuing to hold cmd will keep
  the highlighting active.
- Add ability to drag split panes around by pressing cmd-opt-shift and drgging.
- Add ability to split a pane by dragging a tab into a terminal session.
- Add "move session to split pane" option to context menu.

- By default, a three-finger click on a trackpad emulates the middle button
  (which by default performs Paste).
- Add ability to change profile from Edit Current Session.
- Change mouse cursor to indicate that mouse reporting is on.
- Add cmd-shift-opt-T to open a new tab using the current session's profile.
- Change default global key bindings to cmd-shift-arrows to move tab left/right.
- Add menu item to move tab left/right.
- Add title bars to split panes that show the title. You can drag panes by
  their titles, and there is a menu and a close button in it as well.
- If no window is open, you can now select multiple items in the profiles and
  window and choose split horizontally/vertically to open a new window with the
  split.
- Add tab colors to view menu and tab context menu (thanks, andreax79)
- Add 'move session to window' context menu item.
- When closing a session, free its scrollback buffer in a background thread to
  avoid hanging.
- Alt-click moves the cursor to the click position.
- Press cmd-9 to go to the last tab.
- Add menu item to toggle broadcasting input to the current pane (make
  pane-by-pane toggling available to focus-follows-mouse users who couldn't
  open a context menu in a deselected pane)
- "Find" continues to search as new text appears.

System Integration
------------------
- In Mavericks, when system prefs are set such that multiple screens share one
  space, we only hide the dock and menu when a fullscreen iTerm2 window is on
  the first screen.
- Handle inserting emoji text in mavericks with cmd-ctrl-space.
- Make dock and menu bar appear by moving mouse to top/bottom of screen in
  non-Lion fullscreen mode. Remove hold-cmd-for-tabs.

  windows automatically.

- Support Lion's Restore functionality.
- For new users under Lion, xterm-256color will be the default terminal.
- Add ability to open .itermcolors files by double clicking on them.
- Add 'New Window (Default Profile)' to dock menu.
- Make growl alerts clickable (thanks, soul.cake.tuesday.duck and bauerb).
- Make find text typed in one tab appear in all tabs' find bars.
- App bundle is now signed.
- When a file or folder is dragged onto the dock icon, open it in a new tab
  (not a new window).
- Retina graphics

Proprietary Escape Codes
------------------------
- Add escape code <Esc>]50;SetMark^G to perform Edit > Set Mark command.
- Add escape code to steal focus: ESC ]50;StealFocus^G  (thanks, gordolio).
- Add proprietary escape code esc]50;ClearScrollback^G to erase screen and
  scrollback buffer.
- Add proprietary escape code esc]50;CurrentDir=/Path/To/Directory^G to notify
  iTerm2 of the current directory (so you can cmd-click on relative filenames
  and we'll know where they are).
- Add proprietary escape code <esc>]50;SetProfile=X^G to set the current
  session's profile to the one named X.- Add proprietary escape code to send
  text to clipboard. To use, send esc]50;CopyToClipboard=X^G followed by text
  followed by esc]50;EndCopy^G, where X is a clipboard name from the set: ruler,
  find, font, or general. If not specified, general is used.
- Add esc]50;RequestAttention=x^G, where if x=1 the dock icon bounces and if
  x=0 it stops.

Lots of bug fixes and some teeny new features. Release notes now include the
SHA-256 of the zip file. This is a follow up to the short-lived version
2.9.20160422, which had some crashing bugs.

- Fix two crashes that happened frequently in versions of OS X 10.10 and older
  (failure to remove an observer and use of a 10.11 API)

The following changes were also in 2.9.20160422:

Updates:
- Update libssh to version 1.7 to fix a crash when public key authentication
  fails.
- Update to the latest version of Sparkle, version 1.14.

Major bug fixes:
- Fix a memory leak.
- Fix a crash when changing the number of displays.
- Fix a crash when there is no general pasteboard.
- Improve performance when a tmux window has a lot of tabs.
- Setting the background image via an escape sequence is now disabled when the
  terminal is marked untrusted in advanced prefs.
- Make the scure input menu item indicate the true state of secure input, even
  if another app has turned it on.
- Remember the width that the tab bar was dragged to when it's on the left.

New Features:
- Add regular expression substitution to the advanced paste window.
- Offer to install utilities (currently imgcat and it2dl, which downloads
  files) when you install shell integration.
- Add a new custom escape sequence. OSC 1337 ; ReportCellSize ST will respond
  with OSC 1337 ; ReportCellSize= H ; W ST where H and W are floating point
  values giving the height and width of a cell, respectively.
- Parse /etc/auto_master to find NFS automounts and ignore them for semantic
  history because they tend to be slow to statfs().
- Add Select Current Command to the Edit menu. It selects the command at the
  current command line. It requires that Shell Integration be installed.
- Set TERM_SESSION_ID and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION for compatibility with
  Terminal.app's standard.

Improvements to Automatic Profile Switching:
- Fix a bug where Automatic Profile Switching rules were scored incorrectly.
  Longer rules now outrank shorter rules ceteris paribus, as they always should
  have.
- Add support for "sticky" Automatic Profile Switching rules. A sticky rule
  begins with ! and will stay in effect after its rules no longer match
(provided no other APS rule matches).
- Add support for wildcards in path names in Automatic Profile Switching rules.

Visual Improvements:
- Modernize the look of the Open Quickly window.
- Improve the visual appearance of inactive tabs with colors.
- Left-align tab labels when the tab bar is on the left.
- Add high-contrast themes.

New Preferences:
- Add a checkbox to Window preferences to make non-default background colors
  always opaque.
- Add an advanced preference to disable dictionary lookup on force press.
- Add an advanced preference to specify directories to ignore for semantic
  history.
- Add an off-by-default advanced preference to redraw the screen after Clear
  Buffer is selected.
- Add an advanced preference that makes cmd-click invoke semantic history even
  when iTerm2 is not the active app.

Minor bug fixes:
- Fix a bug where open quickly would not search the names of sessions that had
  been renamed in Get Info.
- Improve how the bold version of your font is chosen.
- Fix a bug where non-anti-aliased underlines were too thick.
- Change how the view is redrawn. It now redraws 30 times per second when
  active. Previously it did some really complicated, poorly understood, and
  probably buggy things with adaptive rates.
- Fix a bug where the hamburger menu's Restart Session item would restart the
  tab's current session, not the session associated with the menu.
- Improve signal handling for shells without job control by making the session
  retoration server a process group leader.
- Fix a bug where trying to tmux -CC attach to a tmux server without a session
  would cause us to write a command to the shell prompt.
- Fix a bug where the activity indicator in a tab wouldn't appear with a dark
  theme, sometimes.
- Reduce CPU usage in certain cases by not drawing tab labels and computing
  their sizes excessively.
- Improve predictability of restoring the default window arrangement.
- Fix a bug where user names were not properly escaped as an argument to login.
- Fix a bug where moving a selection's endpoint by one character with the
  keyboard would move it by two sometimes.
- Fix a bug in how selected text is reported to accessibility.
- Fix a bug where option-click to move the cursor didn't handle double-width
  characters properly.
- Fix a bug where an unterminated DCS code would cause output to be consumed
  indefinitely. Now we stop when we get a control character besides ESC or
  non-ASCII text.
- Pass -q to login if ~/.hushlogin exists. Fixes an issue where open a session
  in a directory other than your home directory would not respect hushlogin.
- Improve the appearance of top-right indicators when timestamps are being
  drawn.
- Allow windows without a title bar to be miniaturized.
- Fix the colors of Advanced Preferences when the preferences panel is not key.
- Fix a bug where right mouse clicks were reported incorrectly.
- Update TextMate's bundle identifier for the new version with captial letters.
- Make the custom escape sequence SetBackgroundImageFile with an empty name
  remove the background image.
- Fix a bug where launching Atom with shell integration would open two files.
- Fix a bug where the current prompt loses the link to its mark when a window
  is resized with bash.
- Improve the visual appearance of marks, especially with larger fonts.
- Highlight marks in red when they have an error code when navigating to them.
- Make the confirmation click prompt to disable tip of the day more noticeable.

<pre id="changelist144023035080955779" style="display: none">tl;dr: Lots of bugs fixed. Significant changes to automatic profile swiitching.
Miscellaneous small new features added.

Major Changes:
- Change how Automatic Profile Switching to keep a stack of profiles. When no
  APS rule is matches the current state, we pop profiles from the stack until it
  has only one or we find one whose rule matches.
- Update to libssh2 version 1.7.0. Fixes a bug where known_hosts entries got
  clobbered and adds new algorithms.

New Prefs:
- Add an advanced setting to disable escape sequences that could be misused by
  untrusted content. Issue 4229.
- Add a new advanced setting to control how many bytes of context are used in
  semantic history. Issue 4399.

Updates to Semantic History:
- Treat IP addresses and hostnames with at least two components as URLs for
  semantic history. Issue 4281.
- When opening a file from semantic history, if no app is able to handle opening
  the file offer the user the option to pick an app and associate it as the
  default viewer. Issue 4281.
- Strip enclosing parentheses, angle brackets, square brackets, apostrophes, and
  quotes from filenames in sementic history (used to be just parens).

Other Improvements:
- Left-side tab bar can now be dragged wider or narrower. Issue 4270.
- When dragging a file to upload with scp into iTerm2, indicate the various drop
  targets' username, hostname, and destination directory.
- When pasting one line ending with a newline to the shell prompt, offer to
  strip the trailing newline.
- Rename the trigger action 'Set Directory' and 'Set Host and User' to reduce
  confusion. Allow 'Report Host and User' to report only the host ("@hostname")
  or only the user ("username@").

This is the recommended beta build for most users. It has major changes over 2.1.1. <a href="/version3.html">Learn all about the iTerm2 version 3 beta release</a>.

<pre id="changelist6009354198115375467" style="display: none">There are a lot of new features in the version 3.0 beta release. It represents
about eighteen months of development. These are just the highlights.

- iTerm2 has been updated for the new Mac OS X Yosemite flat look and is
  stunningly beautiful.

- Shell Integration is a modification to your shell's login script that informs
  iTerm2 of which commands you're running, which host you're logged in to, what
  your user name is, and what your current directory is. This enables all kinds
  of cool features, such as easily navigating to preceding shell prompts,
  getting a notification when a long-running job finishes, drag-dropping files
  to upload and download on remote hosts, and much more. All the details are at
  the <a href="/shell_integration.html">Shell Integration</a> document.

- Session Restoration allows your jobs to keep running after iTerm2 upgrades, is
  force-quit, or crashes. It's like tmux without tmux! Note that this is off by
  default but <a href="https://iterm2.com/restoration.html">it can be enabled in
  advanced settings</a>.

- Using the <a href="/imgcat">imgcat</a> script, iTerm2 can display image files
  right in the terminal--even animated GIFs. See the <a
  href="/images.html">Inline Images</a> document for details.

- The built-in Password Manager saves you from having to remember lots of
  passwords. It uses Mac OS's keychain to securely store them, and has built-in
  guards to prevent them from being accidentally transmitted when not at a
  password prompt. You can even write a Trigger that automatically opens the
  Password Manager at the password prompt.

- Undo closing sessions, tabs, and windows. If you close a session by accident,
  you get five seconds to hit Cmd-Z to undo it.

- Have lots of tabs? Put the tab bar on the left. Quickly search them by recent
  commands, directories, current host name, profile name, and more with the Open
  Quickly feature.

- Dynamic Profiles allow you to store profiles in JSON files. This is really
  handy if you have lots of profiles or want to auto-generate them. See the
  <a href="/dynamic-profiles.html">Dynamic Profiles</a> document for details.

- Never lose your cursor. An optional cursor guide highlights the entire row
  your cursor is on and Cursor Boost dims all colors other than the cursor to
  make it really stand out.

- Performance is greatly improved by parsing the incoming bytes off the main
  thread. Hundreds of bugs have been fixed. Lots of details have been improved:
  for example, if you print a binary file to the console, you're offered the
  option to silence the bell. You can edit strings before you paste them.  You get
  warned before pasting tabs at your shell prompt. And much more!
