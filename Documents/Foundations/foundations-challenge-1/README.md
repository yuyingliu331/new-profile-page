## Setup

2. Go to your own newly created Challenge 1 repository on GitHub and **clone** the repo locally. The link is also given below, and should also appear at the bottom of this page after your press the fork button.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/foundations-challenge-1.git
$ cd foundations-challenge-1
```


## Complete the specs

3. Before completing each spec, read the README.md File located in each folder.
4. Write your code in each `solution_*.js` file so that you can pass the specs in located in the `*_specs.js` files
5. Run the test specs to test your code. To run the specs for a directory, you need to go into that directory and run the command `testem`.

```
$ cd foundations-challenge-1
$ testem
