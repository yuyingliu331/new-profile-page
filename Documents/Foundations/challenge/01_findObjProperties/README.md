####Find Object Properties

The function `findObjectProperties` will take an object as an argument.
Loop over the object and return the names of the keys that are on the object instance,
not on its internal prototype (aka .__proto__).  Return all the keys on the object as
a string. If there is more than one key, each key should be separated by a `","` and a `space`.

##### NOTE: The last test case requires you to use the `Rectangle` function from the `00_rectangle` specs.  **COPY** the `Rectangle` function located in the `solution_rectangle.js` file and **PASTE** the function anywhere in the `solution_findObjProperties.js` file.
