#### Rectangle

Create a constructor function named `Rectangle` that returns an object with color, height, width
properties.  The object returned should have access to a "findArea" function attached
to the constructor function's `.prototype` object which will return the area (width * height).

Names of properties on the instance (the object the `Rectangle` constructor function creates).

- `.color`
- `.height`
- `.width`


Note: The constructor function created will be invoked with the "new" keyword in the test specs,
 you do not have to invoke it with the new keyword.
